        <p>Radha (Sanskrit: राधा, IAST: Rādhā), also called Radhika, is a Hindu goddess and a chief consort of the god Krishna. She is worshiped as the goddess of love, tenderness, compassion and devotion. She is the avatar of Lakshmi[7] and is also described as the chief of the Gopis (milkmaids). During Krishna's youth, she appears as his lover and companion, though he is not married to her.[8][7] In contrast, some traditions and scriptures accord Radha the status of the eternal consort and wife of Krishna.[9][7][10] Radha, as a supreme goddess, is considered as the female counterpart and the internal potency (hladini shakti) of Krishna, who resides in Goloka, the celestial abode of Radha Krishna.[11] Radha is said to accompany Krishna in all his incarnations.[9]</p>
